**Slide 2: Introduction**

*   **Project Introduction:**
    *   Analysis of the Pima Indians Diabetes Dataset to identify key factors and patterns related to diabetes.
    *   Focus on data preprocessing and exploratory data analysis (EDA) to prepare data for potential predictive modeling.
*   **Dataset Name & Source:**
    *   Name: Pima Indians Diabetes Dataset
    *   Source: National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases (via Kaggle or other repository).
*   **Problem Statement:**
    *   To explore the dataset, clean and transform it, and derive initial insights into the features that differentiate diabetic and non-diabetic patients.

**Slide 3: Dataset Overview**

*   **Dataset Shape:**
    *   Rows: 768
    *   Columns: 9
*   **Features:**
    *   8 independent features (Pregnancies, Glucose, BloodPressure, SkinThickness, Insulin, BMI, DiabetesPedigreeFunction, Age).
*   **Target Variable:**
    *   'Outcome' (0 = no diabetes, 1 = diabetes).
*   **Dataset Snippet:**
    *   [*Image needed: A small screenshot or text snippet of the first few rows of the `diabetes_data.csv` file, perhaps after loading into a pandas DataFrame with initial headers.*]
    *   Example:
        ```
        Pregnancies,Glucose,BloodPressure,SkinThickness,Insulin,BMI,DiabetesPedigreeFunction,Age,Outcome
        6,148,72,35,0,33.6,0.627,50,1
        1,85,66,29,0,26.6,0.351,31,0
        ...
        ```

**Slide 4: Data Cleaning**

*   **Steps Taken:**
    *   **Initial Load & Inspection:** Loaded `diabetes_data.csv` (which lacks headers initially) and assigned appropriate column names.
    *   **Duplicate Check:** Checked for duplicate rows (found 0 in this dataset).
    *   **Irrelevant Columns:** No columns were deemed irrelevant for this initial EDA phase.
    *   **Type Conversion:** Ensured all feature columns were converted to appropriate numeric types.
*   **Code Snippet (Illustrative):**
    *   [*Image needed: A concise code snippet showing how column names were assigned and data types were checked or converted.*]
    *   Example:
        ```python
        # column_names = ['Pregnancies', ..., 'Outcome']
        # df = pd.read_csv('../data/diabetes_data.csv', names=column_names)
        # print(df.dtypes)
        # df[column] = pd.to_numeric(df[column], errors='coerce')
        ```

**Slide 5: Handling Missing Values (5 marks)**

*   **Identification:**
    *   Recognized that zero values in 'Glucose', 'BloodPressure', 'SkinThickness', 'Insulin', and 'BMI' are physiologically implausible and represent missing data.
*   **Technique Used:**
    *   Replaced these zero values with `NaN` (Not a Number).
    *   Imputed `NaN` values using the **median** of each respective column.
        *   *Choice Rationale:* Median is robust to outliers present in some of these features.
*   **Missing Values Count:**
    *   **Before Imputation (after 0 to NaN conversion):**
        *   Glucose: 5
        *   BloodPressure: 35
        *   SkinThickness: 227
        *   Insulin: 374
        *   BMI: 11
    *   **After Median Imputation:** 0 missing values in all columns.
*   **Visual:**
    *   [*Image needed: A heatmap of missing values (e.g., `sns.heatmap(df.isnull(), cbar=False)`) shown *before* and *after* imputation, or a table summarizing `df.isnull().sum()` before and after.*]

**Slide 6: Handling Outliers & Data Transformation (3 marks)**

*   **Outlier Detection Method:**
    *   Interquartile Range (IQR) method used to identify potential outliers.
    *   Boxplots visualized to observe outlier presence in features like 'Insulin', 'Pregnancies', 'SkinThickness', 'BMI', 'Age'.
*   **Data Transformation:**
    *   **Log Transformation:** Applied to 'Insulin' (creating 'Insulin_Log') due to its high positive skewness and presence of outliers. `np.log1p` used to handle potential zero values if any remained (though zeros were treated as NaN).
*   **Normalization/Scaling:**
    *   **StandardScaler:** Applied to numerical features to standardize them (mean 0, std 1). This is beneficial for some visualization techniques (like radar charts) and future modeling.
*   **Before vs. After Visualization:**
    *   [*Image needed: Side-by-side histograms or boxplots for the 'Insulin' feature before and after log transformation. Optionally, a boxplot of a scaled feature.*]

**Slide 7: Feature Selection & Engineering (5 marks)**

*   **Feature Selection:**
    *   **Method:** `SelectKBest` with `f_classif` (ANOVA F-value) used to score and rank features based on their relationship with the 'Outcome' variable.
    *   **Selected Features (Top 5 based on scores):** Glucose, BMI, Age, Pregnancies, DiabetesPedigreeFunction (Insulin also scores high but can be complex).
*   **Feature Engineering:**
    *   **BMI_Category:** Created categorical feature from 'BMI' (Underweight, Normal, Overweight, Obese).
    *   **Age_Group:** Created categorical feature from 'Age' (e.g., 20-30, 31-40, 41-50, 51+).
*   **Visual:**
    *   [*Image needed: A bar chart showing feature importance scores from `SelectKBest`, or a correlation heatmap highlighting correlations with the 'Outcome' variable.*]

**Slide 8: Data Integrity & Consistency (4 marks)**

*   **Ensured Consistent Data Types:**
    *   All analytical columns converted to numeric types (`float64` or `int64`) after cleaning. Verified using `df.dtypes`.
*   **Range/Constraint Validation:**
    *   Checked for medically implausible values (e.g., Glucose > 300, BloodPressure > 200, BMI > 60).
    *   Logical checks performed (e.g., very young age with high number of pregnancies).
*   **Removed Inconsistencies:**
    *   Zero values that were logically missing data were replaced.
    *   Duplicate rows were checked for (none found).
*   **Visual/Code Snippet:**
    *   [*Image needed: A small code snippet showing a data type check (`df_cleaned.dtypes`) or a validation logic example (e.g., `df_cleaned[df_cleaned['Glucose'] > 300]`).*]

**Slide 9: Summary Statistics & Insights (4 marks)**

*   **Summary Metrics:**
    *   Utilized `df_cleaned.describe()` to get count, mean, std, min, quartiles, max for all numerical features.
    *   Grouped statistics by 'Outcome' (diabetic vs. non-diabetic) to compare central tendencies and spread.
*   **Key Insights from Statistics:**
    *   **Glucose, BMI, Age:** Mean and median values are noticeably higher for diabetic patients.
    *   **Insulin:** High variability and higher mean/median for diabetic patients.
    *   **Skewness:** Observed in features like 'Insulin', 'DiabetesPedigreeFunction', 'Age', prompting transformations.
*   **Visual:**
    *   [*Image needed: A screenshot of the output from `df_cleaned.describe()` or `df_cleaned.groupby('Outcome').agg(['mean', 'median', 'std'])`.*]
